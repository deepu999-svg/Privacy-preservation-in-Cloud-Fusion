🌐 Privacy-Preserving Cloud Fusion Platform for Infectious Disease Data
This project implements a secure and privacy-preserving cloud fusion system designed for analyzing infectious disease datasets. It integrates multiple data sources while ensuring confidentiality, access control, and blockchain-based integrity. The system supports secure data upload, encryption, fusion, and request handling across trusted entities like Data Owners, Data Consumers, Registry Authorities, and Cloud Servers.

🔐 Key Features
📁 Encrypted dataset uploads from data owners using Apache POI (.xls).

🔍 Disease data analysis requests with access control.

⛓️ Blockchain-based dataset integrity validation.

🧠 Privacy-preserving data fusion across multiple health institutions.

🎨 Smooth UI with Cloud Fusion Theme — modern, glassy design with intuitive navigation.

🤖 Arduino-based IoT integration (e.g., smart car prototype for alert systems).

🧱 Modules
Trusted Authority – Registers and verifies users.

Data Owner – Uploads encrypted datasets.

Cloud Server – Fuses and stores data securely.

Registry Authority – Maintains access logs and blockchain entries.

Data Consumer – Sends analysis requests and views results.
